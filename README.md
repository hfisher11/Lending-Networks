# Lending-Networks
This is code that I wrote or co-wrote in the process of studying interbank lending networks. The project required code that simulates lending networks that reflect the US network of bank loans, solve the equilibrium repayments for each loan in the generated network, randomly add loans and resolve the equilibrium repayments, record statistics about each equilibrium network, and analyze the results. Most of the included code is written by me, but some of it was aided by my research partners Yanet Tadele and Andrew Skemp. Those files have been labled accordingly.
